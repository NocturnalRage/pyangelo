    <h3>Adding Images</h3>
    <p>To add an image you must first <a href="/blog/images">upload it to PyAngelo</a>. Then you copy the link and paste it in the source field of the Insert/Edit image toolbar item.</p>
    <h3>Adding YouTube Videos</h3>
    <p>Add videos as the last step so the formatting stays as it should be. To add a YouTube video hit the source code button, it's the last one to the right on the toolbar. Then add the following code:<p>
    <p>&lt;div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HWbDVtLfH-U" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<p>
    <p>Change the HWbDVtLfH-U code to the ID of the YouTube video.</p>
